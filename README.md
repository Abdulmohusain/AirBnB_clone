# AirBnB_clone

 The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

### Features of this project
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

##### This repository will focus on building a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface and building and defining classes.

###  The classes include
* BaseModel
